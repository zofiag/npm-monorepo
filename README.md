# npm-monorepo
Extremely basic example of npm 7 workspaces and yarn 1 workspaces with TS project references.

For the master branch: In order to bootstrap it run `npm install -g npm@7` and then `npm i` in the root folder.
For the yarn-1-monorepo branch: In order to bootstrap it run `yarn` in the root folder.
